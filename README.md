# Challenge_02_Jarelys_portfolio



## Description

For challenge 02 we were asked to build a portfolio using HTML and advances CSS. Having a portfolio that showcases your work is really important so that it attracts potential employers. Potential employers will be able to review samples of my applications and as well as the deployed applications. This application also adapts to various screen sizes. This is helpful to those who want to access my portfolio through their cell phone, iPad, etc.
